            <p>The first morning in Kyoto, I woke to the sound of temple bells. It was a sound I had encountered in films and read about in literature, but experiencing it physically created an unexpected rupture in my understanding of cultural distance.</p>

            <p>What I discovered during the Asia Kakehashi Project was not simply exposure to a different geography, but a new lens through which to examine my own culture. The Japanese concept of "ma" — the intentional use of negative space — made me reconsider the Indian aesthetic principle of horror vacui, our cultural tendency to fill every surface with pattern and ornament.</p>

            <p>Neither approach is superior. Both are responses to different philosophical priorities. But understanding this required physical displacement, the kind that only comes from standing in a minimalist tea room after growing up surrounded by maximalist temple architecture.</p>

            <h2>The Paradox of Distance</h2>

            <p>Cultural exchange programs are often marketed as opportunities to "understand others." What they rarely advertise is that the primary understanding you gain is about yourself.</p>

            <blockquote>"The stranger sees what the native cannot see precisely because what the native sees is structured by long familiarity."</blockquote>

            <p>This is not to romanticize displacement. There is real difficulty in being perpetually out of context. But there is also a clarity that comes from occupying that liminal space.</p>
