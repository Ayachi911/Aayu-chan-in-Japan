      <h1>The Japan Exchange Survival Guide I Wish I Had at 16</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        This isn’t a travel checklist. It’s what actually matters when you leave home,
        land in Japan, and realize no one prepared you for how different life would feel.
      </p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p>
        When you’re selected for a high-school exchange to Japan, everyone congratulates you.
        Teachers smile. Relatives say how “lucky” you are. Your friends imagine anime streets
        and vending machines.
      </p>

      <p>
        What no one tells you is that the hardest part won’t be the language, the food,
        or even the rules.
        It will be <em>you</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        You will meet a version of yourself that has no shortcuts — no familiar systems,
        no social status, no confidence borrowed from being “good at school back home.”
        And that’s exactly why this experience can change you, if you survive it properly.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>1. Packing Is Easy. Preparing Your Mind Is Not.</h2>

      <p>
        Most exchange prep sessions obsess over what to pack.
        Clothes. Shoes. Gifts. Medicines.
        Those matter — but they’re not what breaks students.
      </p>

      <p>
        What actually hurts is the sudden loss of control.
        In Japan, especially in a school setting, your day is structured for you.
        When to arrive. Where to sit. When to speak.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re used to freedom, spontaneity, or constant feedback, this can feel suffocating.
        You might mistake discipline for coldness.
        You might mistake silence for dislike.
      </p>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>What I wish I understood earlier:</strong>
        Japan doesn’t reward confidence. It rewards consistency.
        Learn to observe before you react.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Your Host Family Is Not Your Best Friend</h2>

      <p>
        Many students arrive expecting a warm, movie-style family dynamic.
        Some do get that.
        Most don’t — and that’s not a failure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Host families operate on unspoken expectations.
        Cleanliness. Quietness. Routine.
        They are hosting you out of responsibility and goodwill, not obligation to entertain.
      </p>

      <p>
        If something feels distant, it doesn’t mean you are unwanted.
        It often means you are being respected as a guest.
      </p>

      <p>
        The fastest way to gain trust is reliability.
        Doing chores without being asked.
        Returning home on time.
        Saying less, but meaning it.
      </p>
    </section>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <section>
      <h2>3. School Will Test You in Unexpected Ways</h2>

      <p>
        Japanese schools are not academically harder in the way people imagine.
        They are psychologically harder.
      </p>

      <p>
        You may understand the material but still feel lost.
        Classes move together, not individually.
        Standing out — positively or negatively — draws attention.
      </p>

      <p>
        You will be watched.
        Not to judge you, but to see if you can adapt.
      </p>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Uncomfortable truth:</strong>
        Trying too hard to be “interesting” can isolate you faster than being quiet.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Loneliness Is Part of the Program</h2>

      <p>
        There will be days when everything works on paper,
        but you still feel hollow.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not failure.
        This is what happens when your identity is stripped down to basics.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most students panic here.
        They retreat into their phones.
        They count days.
        They emotionally check out.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ones who grow accept loneliness as temporary —
        and use it to listen, observe, and mature.
      </p>
    </section>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <section>
      <h2>5. You Will Mess Up — And That’s Fine</h2>

      <p>
        You will bow incorrectly.
        Speak at the wrong time.
        Misread silence.
        Over-apologize or under-react.
      </p>

      <p>
        What matters is how you recover.
        In Japan, recovery matters more than perfection.
      </p>

      <p>
        Own the mistake quietly.
        Adjust behavior.
        Move on.
      </p>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Remember:</strong>
        Respect is not loud. It’s cumulative.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. What You Take Back Matters More Than What You Post</h2>

      <p>
        Photos fade.
        Souvenirs collect dust.
      </p>

      <p>
        What stays is the internal shift:
        patience,
        self-control,
        awareness of others.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Japan exchange is not about becoming “cool” or worldly.
        It’s about learning how to exist in a system larger than yourself.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you let it,
        this experience will quietly raise your standards —
        for yourself and for the life you choose next.
      </p>
