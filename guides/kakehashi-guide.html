            <p>So you want to go to Japan through the Asia Kakehashi Project? I was selected in 2021 at age 16, and I'm going to walk you through exactly what the process looks like.</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <strong>💡 Most Important Tip</strong>
                Start your application prep at least 3 months before the deadline. This isn't something you can rush!
            </div>

            <h2>What is Asia Kakehashi Project?</h2>

            <p>It's a fully-funded exchange program run by the Japanese government where you get to visit Japan for a full year, attend a Japanese high school, and live with a host family.</p>

            <p>The best part? It's <strong>completely free</strong> — they cover your flights, accommodation, meals, and even give you a monthly stipend.</p>

            <h2>Who Can Apply?</h2>

            <p>Here's what you need:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Age between 15-18 years old</li>
                <li>Currently enrolled as a student in India</li>
                <li>Able to communicate in English (you don't need to be fluent)</li>
                <li>Genuinely interested in Japanese culture and international exchange</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="divider">🌸</div>

            <h2>The Application Process</h2>

            <p>The application usually opens in August-September. You'll need:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>School ID card (scanned copy)</li>
                <li>Passport-size photo</li>
                <li>School principal's recommendation letter</li>
                <li>Essay (this is where you win or lose)</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="checklist-box">
                <h3>📋 Application Checklist</h3>
                <ul class="interactive-checklist">

            <h2>The Essay (Most Important Part)</h2>

            <ul>

                <li>Connecting it to something I'd actually DO after the program</li>
                <li>Writing in my own voice, not trying to sound overly formal</li>
                <li>Showing genuine curiosity, not just listing achievements</li>
            </ul>
